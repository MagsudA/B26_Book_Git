14. How The Strings Are Stored In The Memory?
We all know that JVM divides the allocated memory to a Java program into two parts.
one is Stack and another one is heap. Stack is used for execution purpose and heap is
used for storage purpose. In that heap memory, JVM allocates some memory specially
meant for string literals. This part of the heap memory is called String Constant Pool.
Whenever you create a string object using string literal, that object is stored in the
string constant pool and whenever you create a string object using new keyword, such
object is stored in the heap memory.
